Installation
============

``mdacli`` is a *pluging* tool for `MDAnalysis <https://www.mdanalysis.org/>`_. Because ``mdacli`` is such a domain-specific tool, its installation manages no dependencies, and assumes a functional ``MDAnalysis`` is already installed. Before installing ``mdacli`` please install ``MDAnalysis`` and all its dependencies. After that, install ``mdacli`` from ``PyPI``::

    pip install mdacli
