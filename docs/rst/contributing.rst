Here we explain how to contribute to a project that adopted this template. Actually, you can use this same scheme when contributing to this template. If you are completely new to ``git`` this might not be the best beginner tutorial, but will be very good still ;-)

You will notice that the text that appears is a mirror of the ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` file. You can also point your community to that file (or the docs) to guide them in the steps required to interact with you project.

.. include:: ../CONTRIBUTING.rst
