# MDAnalysis CLI interface

A simple command line interface (CLI) to the analysis classes of [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org) 
using argparse. This project is in an early developing stage and 
work in progress.

Provided you have MDAnalysis installed, install `mdacli` with the following:

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

and run ``mdacli``,

```bash
mdacli -h
```
